                "- Multiple **Task Processors** receiving work via PULL sockets, processing it, and sending results via PUSH sockets.\n",
                "- A **Result Collector** gathering results using a PULL socket.\n",

                "- **Error Handling**: More robust error reporting from workers.\n",
                "- **Dynamic Workers**: Workers could join and leave the pool dynamically.\n",
                "- **Load Balancing**: ZMQ's REQ/REP or DEALER/ROUTER patterns can offer more sophisticated load balancing.\n",
                "- **PUB/SUB for Broadcasts**: If agents need to broadcast information (e.g., state changes, events), PUB/SUB is suitable.\n",
                "- **Complex Task Payloads**: Using structured data formats like JSON (as shown) or Protocol Buffers for messages.\n",
                "- **Integration with AI Logic**: Each `task_processor_agent` could internally use an AI engine (like `AIEngine` from your framework) to perform its task.\n",
