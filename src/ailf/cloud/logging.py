"""Cloud-specific logging functionality.

This module provides cloud-specific logging implementations that integrate with
cloud logging services like Google Cloud Logging, AWS CloudWatch, etc.

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from ailf.cloud.logging import setup_cloud_logging
    
    logger = setup_cloud_logging('my_service')
    logger.info('This message will be logged to the cloud provider')
    ```

This module extends the core logging functionality in ailf.core.logging
with cloud-specific features.
