"""Pydantic schemas for Model Context Protocol (MCP)."""

# This file is initially empty. Schemas will be added as MCP integration develops.
# Example of what might be here later:
# from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
# from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

# class MCPMessage(BaseModel):
#     version: str = Field(default="1.0")
#     message_id: str
#     # ... other common MCP fields
