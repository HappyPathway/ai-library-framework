# Migration Report: Transition to src-based Project Layout

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Module Migration
Successfully migrated the following modules from legacy to src-based layout:

- **AI Engine Module**
  - `/utils/ai/engine.py` → `/src/ailf/ai/engine.py`
  - Implemented all core functionality including AIEngine class, custom exceptions, and utility functions

- **Tooling Module**
  - `/ailf/tooling/manager.py` → `/src/ailf/tooling/manager.py`
  - `/ailf/tooling/selector.py` → `/src/ailf/tooling/selector.py`
  - `/ailf/tooling/__init__.py` → `/src/ailf/tooling/__init__.py`

- **Schema Definitions**
  - Created updated schemas at `/src/ailf/schemas/tooling.py`
  - Implemented all necessary models: ToolDescription, ToolRegistryEntry, etc.

### 2. Structure Modifications

- Created proper package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Updated imports to reflect new src-based layout
- Adapted examples to use the new module paths

### 3. Testing

- Created verification scripts to confirm file existence and structure
- Updated existing examples to use the new module paths
- Tested basic functionality of migrated components

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Remaining Module Migrations

The following modules still need to be migrated:

- `/ailf/cognition/` → `/src/ailf/cognition/`
- `/ailf/communication/` → `/src/ailf/communication/`
- `/ailf/feedback/` → `/src/ailf/feedback/`
- `/ailf/interaction/` → `/src/ailf/interaction/`
- `/ailf/memory/` → `/src/ailf/memory/`
- `/ailf/registry_client/` → `/src/ailf/registry_client/`
- `/ailf/routing/` → `/src/ailf/routing/`
- Additional `/utils/` modules → appropriate locations in `/src/ailf/`

### 2. Update Import References

- Update all modules to use the new import paths
- Fix any circular import issues that may arise

### 3. Test Suite Updates

- Update all tests to work with the new src structure
- Create comprehensive tests for all migrated modules

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Update documentation to reflect the new directory structure
- Create migration guide for developers

## Known Issues

1. The migration of the full AIEngine class is complete, but instantiating it requires dependencies that also need migration
2. The logging system needs to be updated to work correctly with the new structure

## Conclusion

The migration to a src-based layout is well underway, with key components like the AI Engine and Tooling modules successfully migrated. The remaining work involves continuing this process for other modules and ensuring all cross-references are updated accordingly.

This migration will ultimately result in a more maintainable and standardized Python package structure that follows best practices.
