# Comprehensive Testing and Verification Plan for AILF

This plan outlines automated testing strategies and manual verification workflows to ensure each component of the AILF framework functions as designed. The goal is to achieve high confidence in the correctness and robustness of the framework.

## I. General Testing Setup and Principles

*   **Testing Framework**: `pytest` will be used for all automated tests.
*   **Directory Structure**:
    *   `tests/unit/`: For isolated tests of individual modules, classes, and functions. Dependencies will be mocked.
    *   `tests/integration/`: For testing the interaction between different components of the `ailf` framework or with external services (e.g., Redis, databases, A2A peers).
    *   `tests/e2e/` (End-to-End): For testing complete agent workflows from input to output, simulating real-world use cases.
*   **Fixtures**: Reusable test setups, mock objects, and sample data will be managed using `pytest` fixtures in `conftest.py` files at appropriate levels (root, unit, integration).
*   **Mocking**: `unittest.mock` (or `pytest-mock`) will be used extensively in unit tests to isolate components.
*   **Data Validation**: Pydantic models will be used to generate valid test data and to validate inputs/outputs of components.
*   **Asynchronous Code**: Tests for `async` functions will be written using `pytest-asyncio`.
*   **Coverage**: Code coverage will be measured using `pytest-cov` to identify untested parts of the codebase.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: All tests will be integrated into a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run automatically on every push or pull request.

        *   The first agent correctly serializes and sends the ACP message.
        *   The second agent correctly receives and deserializes the ACP message.

    3.  **Task Management**: Create a task, get its status, send messages related to the task, cancel the task. Verify server responses and state changes.
    4.  **SSE**: If the server supports SSE for task updates, subscribe to the SSE stream and observe events.
    5.  **UX Negotiation**: If implemented, test scenarios involving `UXNegotiationMessage` alignment with A2A concepts.

### B. Advanced A2A Protocol Features

*   **Components**:
    *   A2A Push Notification Support (`ailf.communication.a2a_push`)
    *   A2A Registry Integration (`ailf.communication.a2a_registry`)
    *   A2A Multi-Agent Orchestration (`ailf.communication.a2a_orchestration`)
*   **Automated Tests**:
    *   **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/a2a/advanced/`)**:
        *   `test_a2a_push_notifications.py`:
            *   Test push notification manager logic for sending updates. Mock webhook dispatch.
            *   Test client-side handling for receiving webhook events (if part of `ailf`).
            *   Verify serialization for datetime objects in notifications.
        *   `test_a2a_registry.py`:
            *   Test registry manager for discovering agents. Mock interactions with actual registry services.
            *   Test registration of AILF agents.
            *   Test capability-based discovery logic.
        *   `test_a2a_orchestration.py`:
            *   Test orchestration framework logic (routing, conditional routing, sequential chains, parallel groups).
            *   Mock individual agent communications within the orchestration.
            *   Verify correct sequencing and data flow in orchestrated workflows.
    *   **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/a2a/advanced/`)**:
        *   `test_a2a_push_integration.py`: Setup an A2A server that sends push notifications and a mock client endpoint to receive them. Verify notification delivery and content.
        *   `test_a2a_registry_integration.py`: Test with a live (test instance) A2A registry. Register an `ailf` agent, then discover it.
        *   `test_a2a_orchestration_flow.py`: Setup multiple simple A2A agent services (can be `ailf`-based). Use the orchestration framework to execute a workflow involving these agents. Verify the overall outcome.
*   **Manual Verification**:
    1.  **Push Notifications**: Trigger an event on an A2A server that should send a push notification. Have a client (e.g., a simple webhook listener script) ready to receive it. Verify the notification arrives and contains correct data.
    2.  **Registry**: Use an AILF agent to register with an A2A registry. Use another AILF agent (or tool) to discover it based on capabilities.
    3.  **Orchestration**: Define a multi-step workflow using the orchestration framework involving 2-3 simple AILF A2A agents. Execute the workflow and verify that each agent performs its part and the final result is as expected.

### C. A2A Future Development (Testing Approach)

For items marked `[ ]` (not yet implemented):

*   **Performance Optimization**:
    *   **Automated**: Develop benchmark scripts (e.g., using `pytest-benchmark` or custom scripts with tools like Locust or k6) to measure throughput, latency, and resource usage of A2A client/server operations under various loads. These become part of the test suite to track performance regressions.
    *   **Manual**: Not directly applicable for benchmarks, but manual observation under load can sometimes reveal bottlenecks.
*   **Interoperability Testing**:
    *   **Automated**:
        *   Set up instances of other A2A implementations (LangGraph, CrewAI, AG2) if they offer testable interfaces or Docker images.
        *   Write integration tests where `ailf`'s `A2AClient` interacts with these external A2A servers, and vice-versa (external A2A clients interact with `ailf` A2A servers).
        *   Develop a compatibility validation suite that runs a predefined set of A2A interactions against different implementations.
    *   **Manual**: Manually configure an `ailf` agent to communicate with an agent built using another A2A framework. Perform basic task exchanges.
*   **Real-world Applications**:
    *   **Automated**: Develop E2E tests for any example or template "real-world applications" built with `ailf`. These tests would simulate user interactions and verify the application's overall functionality.
    *   **Manual**: Deploy and use the example applications. Follow defined use cases and verify outcomes. Test monitoring tools by observing metrics and logs during application use.

## IV. Verification of Examples and Documentation

*   **Automated Tests**:
    *   Ensure all code snippets in documentation (especially guides and tutorials) are runnable and produce the expected output. This can be achieved using tools like `pytest --doctest-modules` or by extracting snippets into testable example files.
    *   Any full example applications in `examples/` should have their own set of unit, integration, or E2E tests.
*   **Manual Verification**:
    *   Regularly review documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
    *   Manually follow tutorials and guides to ensure they are easy to understand and steps are correct.
    *   Run example applications and verify they behave as described.

## V. Test Data Management

*   Use Pydantic models with libraries like `Faker` to generate realistic and varied test data.
*   Store larger, static test datasets in `tests/data/` and load them in fixtures.
*   Ensure sensitive information is not hardcoded in test data; use environment variables or mock secrets.

This plan provides a structured approach to verifying the `ailf` framework. It should be treated as a living document and updated as the framework evolves.
