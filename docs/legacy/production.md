Specific Recommendations
Based on your project, here are three concrete actions to take right away:

1. Create a Comprehensive Quickstart Guide
Create a "Quick Start" guide that allows new users to get up and running in under 10 minutes. This guide should:

Walk them through installing your library
Show how to create a simple agent
Demonstrate key functionality

2. Implement a Unified Agent Framework ⚠️
Looking at your examples and modules, it seems you have many building blocks but perhaps not a unified "Agent" class that ties everything together. We've made progress on this framework with:

- Base Agent class at `/src/ailf/agent/base.py`
- Planning strategies at `/src/ailf/agent/patterns/__init__.py`
- Tool integration at `/src/ailf/agent/tools/__init__.py`
- Example agent usage at `/examples/agent_example.py`
- Unit tests at `/tests/unit/agent/test_agent_framework.py`

Implementation Status:
- ✅ Core framework designed and implemented
- ❌ Need to resolve package discovery issues
- ❌ Tests not passing yet due to module importing issues

Next steps to complete the implementation:

1. Fix the package discovery to ensure the agent module is properly included
   - Update `pyproject.toml` to explicitly include the agent module
   - Ensure the package is re-installed properly with `pip install -e .`
   - Verify module discovery with `python -c "import ailf.agent"`

2. Update module imports to work with existing codebase
   - Ensure proper integration with existing AI engine implementations
   - Adapt any core modules that the agent framework depends on

3. Ensure tests pass with the correct module imports
   - Fix import paths in test files
   - Update mocks to work with the actual implementation 

4. Complete the example application to demonstrate full capabilities
   - Create a comprehensive demo in `examples/agent_example.py`
   - Document the example with step-by-step explanations

5. Create comprehensive documentation for the agent framework
   - Create a user guide in `/docs/guides/agent_framework.md`
   - Add API documentation for all agent-related classes
   - Include best practices and examples

This unified agent framework will provide users clear patterns to follow when building agents, rather than piecing together utilities.

3. Create a Demo Showcase Application
Build and document a "showcase" application that demonstrates a real-world use case. This serves both as documentation and proof of capability. For example, a simple research assistant that:

Takes user questions
Searches multiple knowledge sources
Uses tools like web browsing, calculation
Produces a structured answer
Would you like me to help implement any of these suggestions? For example, I could draft a comprehensive quickstart guide or help design the unified agent framework.
