# Tree of Thoughts Implementation

## Overview

The Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is an advanced reasoning technique that extends beyond simple prompt-response patterns. This approach allows AI agents to explore multiple reasoning paths, evaluate intermediate steps, and backtrack when necessary to find optimal solutions for complex problems.

This document outlines how the Tree of Thoughts pattern can be implemented within the AILF framework.

## Core Components

### 1. Schema Definitions

#### Thought Node Schema

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ThoughtState(str, Enum):
    ACTIVE = "active"           # Currently being explored
    COMPLETED = "completed"     # Exploration completed
    ABANDONED = "abandoned"     # Abandoned due to low evaluation
    PENDING = "pending"         # Queued for exploration

class ThoughtNode(BaseModel):
    """Represents a single thought in the reasoning tree."""
    id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for the thought")
    parent_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Parent thought ID (None for root)")
    content: str = Field(..., description="The actual thought content")
    depth: int = Field(0, description="Depth level in the tree")
    state: ThoughtState = Field(ThoughtState.PENDING, description="Current state of the thought")
    evaluation_score: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="Quality score (0.0-1.0)")
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description="Additional metadata")
    
    def add_child(self, content: str) -> "ThoughtNode":
        """Create a child thought node from this node."""
        # Implementation in processor class
        pass
```

#### ToT Configuration Schema

```python
from typing import Callable, Optional, List, Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ToTEvaluationStrategy(str, Enum):
    VALUE_BASED = "value_based"   # Evaluate based on expected value/utility
    OBJECTIVE_BASED = "objective_based"  # Evaluate against objective criteria
    SIMULATION_BASED = "simulation_based"  # Evaluate by simulating outcomes

class ToTConfiguration(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for Tree of Thoughts processing."""
    max_depth: int = Field(3, description="Maximum depth of the thought tree")
    branching_factor: int = Field(3, description="Number of branches to explore per node")
    beam_width: int = Field(5, description="Number of active paths to maintain")
    temperature: float = Field(0.7, description="Temperature for thought generation")
    evaluation_strategy: ToTEvaluationStrategy = Field(
        ToTEvaluationStrategy.VALUE_BASED,
        description="Strategy for evaluating thoughts"
    )
    custom_evaluation_prompt: Optional[str] = Field(
        None, 
        description="Custom prompt template for evaluation"
    )
```

### 3. Integration with AILF Framework

```python

from ailf.schemas.cognition import TaskContext, ProcessingResult

class ToTCognitionProcessor(CognitionProcessor):
    """Tree of Thoughts cognition processor for AILF framework."""
    
    def __init__(

        # Extract problem from context
        problem = context.user_input
        
        # Run ToT processing
        tot_result = await self.tot_processor.process(problem, context)
        
        # Convert to standard processing result
        return ProcessingResult(
            output=tot_result["solution"],
            reasoning=str([t.content for t in tot_result["reasoning_path"]]),

        scores = [node.evaluation_score or 0.0 for node in tot_result["reasoning_path"]]
        return sum(scores) / len(scores)
```

## Example Usage

```python
async def solve_problem_with_tot():
    # Initialize components
    ai_engine = AIEngine(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
    
    # Configure ToT
    tot_config = ToTConfiguration(
        max_depth=4,
        branching_factor=3,
        beam_width=5,
        temperature=0.8
    )
    
    # Create processor
    tot_processor = ToTCognitionProcessor(ai_engine, tot_config)
    
    # Define problem
    problem = "Design a system architecture for a real-time analytics platform that can process 10,000 events per second."
    
    # Create context
    context = TaskContext(
        user_input=problem,
        conversation_history=[],
        task_type="planning"
    )
    
    # Process with ToT
    result = await tot_processor.process(context)
    
    # Output results
    print(f"Solution: {result.output}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Explored nodes: {result.metadata['explored_nodes']}")
    
    # Optionally visualize the thought tree
    # visualization.render_tree(result.metadata['reasoning_tree'])
```

## Prompt Templates

### Thought Generation Prompt

```
Given the following problem and current state of reasoning, generate {branching_factor} possible next steps or thoughts.

Problem: {problem}

Current reasoning path:
{current_path}

Generate {branching_factor} different, creative possible next thoughts:
1.
```

### Thought Evaluation Prompt

```
Evaluate the following thought in the context of solving the given problem. Rate from 0.0 (not helpful) to 1.0 (extremely valuable).

Problem: {problem}

Context: {context}

Thought to evaluate: {thought}

Evaluation criteria:
1. Relevance to the problem
2. Potential to lead to a solution
3. Logical coherence 
4. Originality/Creativity
5. Feasibility

First provide your reasoning, then conclude with a numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0.
```
