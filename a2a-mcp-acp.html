What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic, defines a standardized interface for supplying structured, real-time context to large language models (LLMs).

üí° Catch up with my previous article about MCP.üí°


https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
Core Functionalities
Contextual Data Injection
MCP lets you pull in external resources ‚Äî like files, database rows, or API responses ‚Äî right into the prompt or working memory. All of it comes through a standardized interface, so your LLM can stay lightweight and clean.

Function Routing & Invocation
MCP also lets models call tools dynamically. You can register capabilities like searchCustomerData or generateReport, and the LLM can invoke them on demand. It‚Äôs like giving your AI access to a toolbox, but without hardwiring the tools into the model itself.

Prompt Orchestration
Rather than stuffing your prompt with every possible detail, MCP helps assemble just the context that matters. Think modular, on-the-fly prompt construction ‚Äî smarter context, fewer tokens, better outputs.

Implementation Characteristics
Operates over HTTP(S) with JSON-based capability descriptors
Designed to be model-agnostic ‚Äî any LLM with a compatible runtime can leverage MCP-compliant servers
Compatible with API gateways and enterprise authentication standards (e.g., OAuth2, mTLS)
Engineering Use Cases
‚ûÄ LLM integrations for internal APIs: Enable secure, read-only or interactive access to structured business data without exposing raw endpoints.

‚ûÅ Enterprise agents: Equip autonomous agents with runtime context from tools like Salesforce, SAP, or internal knowledge bases.

‚ûÇ Dynamic prompt construction: Tailor prompts based on user session, system state, or task pipeline logic

What is ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)?
The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an open standard originally proposed by BeeAI and IBM to enable structured communication, discovery, and coordination between AI agents operating in the same local or edge environment.

Unlike cloud-oriented protocols such as A2A or context-routing protocols like MCP, ACP is designed for local-first, real-time agent orchestration with minimal network overhead and tight integration across agents deployedc within a shared runtime.

Protocol Design & Architecture
ACP defines a decentralized agent environment in which:

Each agent advertises its identity, capabilities, and state using a local broadcast/discovery layer.
Agents communicate through event-driven messaging, often using a local bus or IPC (inter-process communication) system.
A runtime controller (optional) can orchestrate agent behavior, aggregate telemetry, and enforce execution policies.
ACP agents typically operate as lightweight, stateless services or containers with a shared communication substrate.

Implementation Characteristics
Designed for low-latency environments (e.g., local orchestration, robotics, offline edge AI)
Can be implemented over gRPC, ZeroMQ, or custom runtime buses
Emphasizes local sovereignty ‚Äî no cloud dependency or external service registration required
Supports capability typing and semantic descriptors for automated task routing
Engineering Use Cases
‚ûÄ Multi-agent orchestration on edge devices (e.g., drones, IoT clusters, or robotic fleets)

‚ûÅ Local-first LLM systems coordinating model invocations, sensor inputs, and action execution

‚ûÇ Autonomous runtime environments where agents must coordinate without centralized cloud infrastructure

In short, ACP offers a runtime-local protocol layer for modular AI systems ‚Äî prioritizing low-latency coordination, resilience, and composability. It‚Äôs a natural fit for privacy-sensitive, autonomous, or edge-first deployments where cloud-first protocols are impractical.

What is A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)?
The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol, introduced by Google, is a cross-platform specification for enabling AI agents to communicate, collaborate, and delegate tasks across heterogeneous systems.


https://google.github.io/
Unlike ACP‚Äôs local-first focus or MCP‚Äôs tool integration layer, A2A addresses horizontal interoperability ‚Äî standardizing how agents from different vendors or runtimes can exchange capabilities and coordinate workflows over the open web.

Protocol Overview
A2A defines a HTTP-based communication model where agents are treated as interoperable services. Each agent exposes an ‚ÄúAgent Card‚Äù ‚Äî a machine-readable JSON descriptor detailing its identity, capabilities, endpoints, and authentication requirements.

Agents use this information to:

Discover each other programmatically
Negotiate tasks and roles
Exchange messages, data, and streaming updates
A2A is transport-layer agnostic in principle, but currently specifies JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS as its core mechanism for interaction.

Core Components
Agent Cards
JSON documents describing an agent‚Äôs capabilities, endpoints, supported message types, auth methods, and runtime metadata.

A2A Client/Server Interface
Each agent may function as a client (task initiator), a server (task executor), or both, enabling dynamic task routing and negotiation.

Message & Artifact Exchange
Supports multipart tasks with context, streaming output (via SSE), and persistent artifacts (e.g., files, knowledge chunks).

User Experience Negotiation
Agents can adapt message format, content granularity, and visualization to match downstream agent capabilities.

Security Architecture
OAuth 2.0 and API key-based authorization
Capability-scoped endpoints ‚Äî agents only expose functions required for declared interactions
Agents can operate in ‚Äúopaque‚Äù mode ‚Äî hiding internal logic while revealing callable services
Implementation Characteristics
Web-native by design: built on HTTP, JSON-RPC, and standard web security
Model-agnostic: works with any agent system (LLM or otherwise) that implements the protocol
Supports task streaming and multi-turn collaboration with lightweight payloads
Engineering Use Cases
‚ûÄ Cross-platform agent ecosystems where agents from different teams or vendors need to interoperate securely

‚ûÅ Distributed agent orchestration in cloud-native AI environments (e.g., Vertex AI, LangChain, HuggingFace Agents)

‚ûÇ Multi-agent collaboration frameworks, such as enterprise AI workflows that span multiple systems (e.g., CRM, HR, IT agents)

Protocols Compared Side-by-Side

Complementary or Competitive?
A2A + MCP
A2A and MCP aren‚Äôt fighting each other ‚Äî they‚Äôre solving totally different parts of the agentic AI puzzle, and they actually fit together pretty nicely.


https://google.github.io/
Think of MCP as the protocol that lets AI agents plug into the world. It gives them access to files, APIs, databases ‚Äî basically, all the structured context they need to do something useful. Whether it‚Äôs pulling real-time sales data or generating a custom report, MCP handles the connection to tools and data.

Now layer on A2A. This is where agents start collaborating. A2A gives them a shared language and set of rules to discover each other, delegate tasks, and negotiate how they‚Äôll work together ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre built by different vendors or running on different platforms.

So here‚Äôs a simple way to think about it:
‚ü¢ MCP connects AI to tools.
‚ü¢ A2A connects AI to other AI.

Together, they form a strong modular base for building smart, collaborative systems.

What About ACP?
Then there‚Äôs ACP, which takes a different approach altogether. It‚Äôs all about local-first agent coordination ‚Äî no cloud required. Instead of using HTTP and web-based discovery, ACP enables agents to find and talk to each other right inside a shared runtime.

This is perfect for situations where:

You have limited bandwidth or need low-latency (like in robotics or on-device assistants),
Privacy matters and you want to keep everything offline,
Or you‚Äôre deploying in environments cut off from the internet (e.g., factory floors, edge nodes).
ACP isn‚Äôt trying to compete with A2A ‚Äî it just fills a different niche. But in some setups, especially in tightly controlled environments, ACP might replace A2A entirely, because it skips the overhead of web-native protocols and just gets the job done locally.

Convergence or Fragmentation?
As more teams adopt these protocols, a few possible futures are taking shape.

Best case? We see convergence. Imagine a unified agent platform where A2A handles the back-and-forth between agents, MCP manages access to tools and data, and ACP-style runtimes plug in for edge or offline scenarios. Everything just works, and developers can build on top without worrying which protocol is doing what behind the scenes.

Worst case? Things fragment. Different vendors push their own flavors of A2A or MCP, and we end up with a mess ‚Äî like the early days of web services, when nothing talked to anything else without a lot of glue code.

The middle ground? Open-source tools and middleware could save the day. These projects would sit between agents and protocols, abstracting the differences and giving devs a clean, unified API ‚Äî while translating under the hood depending on where and how your agents run.

In short: we‚Äôre early. But how we build and adopt these standards now will shape whether AI agents become a cohesive ecosystem ‚Äî or a patchwork of silos.

If you‚Äôre wondering where to start or how to bring it all together, the team at Addepto can help. We‚Äôve taken companies from ‚ÄúWhat do we even do with this?‚Äù to fully operational agent ecosystems ‚Äî fast. You can also hit me up on Linkedin.
